# osu!BackgroundChanger

## What is it, and how does it work?
- It's an osu! background changer, you can edit the home background with any image you want without the osu!supporter.
- To make sure it works, please make sure to put the seasonal background option as always.

## Features:
- Import
  - Import your own image for the home background
  - You can extract the seasonal background (before replacing)
- Reset
  - Delete all of the images you have imported, make sure to launch the game and press next song around 20 times to load all the old backgrounds (it can also fix some problems)
- Convert
    - Convert png to jpg
- Locking
    - Prevents OSU! from replacing the background as long as the program is running.

## Version 1.0-PATCH

- **Required Libraries:** Costura.Fody.5.5.0
